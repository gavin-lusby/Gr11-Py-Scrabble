SCRABBLE RULES/HOW TO PLAY

1. General

	- Scrabble can be played with two, three, or four players
	
	- The objective of the game is to get the most points by using letter tiles to form 
		horizontal or vertical English words that are attached to existing words, all while
		taking advantage of letter tile values, existing words, and Word Premiums / 
		Letter Premiums
	
	- During a turn, you may choose to place one or more tiles, or swap one or more tiles
		for new tiles, however you cannot do both
		
	- Any tiles replaced for swapping or placing letters are only replaced at the beginning of 
		next turn
	
	- There are one hundred tiles to begin with, of which each player gets seven to start
	
	- There is a predetermined amount of each letter tile
	
	- Words are only 2-8 letters in this version
		

2. Placement
	
	- The very first tile of the game must be in the center
	
	- You may only create horizontal and vertical words, not diagonal words
	
	- The first word created in the game must cross over center, and must be at least 2 
	characers long
	
	- Every tile except the first tile of the game must be placed adjacent to an existing tile
	
	- Once you have placed the first tile of your turn, you may only place subsequent tiles 
		adjacent to it, or on the other side of a word from it
			
	- Once you have placed the second tile of your turn, you are locked to any reachable tiles
		in that row/column(whether it's row or column depends on where your first tile 
		was relative to the second one)
		
	- If you place a blank tile you can choose any letter for it to become
	
	- If you place a blank tile, the square will become purple at the end of the turn to
		indicate to players that it is a blank
		
3. Scoring

	- Each letter tile has a predetermined score

	- All words created/added to in any turn must create new words, otherwise they are 
		invalid
	
	- If you end your turn with any invalid words on the board, you will be forced to restart
		your turn
	
	- You will receive full points from any words you create/add to during a given turn, even 
		if there are multiple
		
	- Letter Premium tiles(tiles that say DL or TL) are tiles that give you double or triple 
		point value for the specific letter tile on it
		
	- Word Premium tiles(the center tile, and tiles that say DW or TW) are tiles that give you 
		double or triple point value for any word that crosses over it
		
	- Letter Premiums are added to score before Word Premiums
	
	- Word Premiums stack multiplicatively with each other
	
	- The middle spot applies a Double Word Premium(for the first word of the game)

	- Once a turn is completed where a Premium Tile is used, that tile loses it's Word 
		Premium / Letter Premium bonus
		
	- If a player uses seven tiles in one turn, they are granted fifty points in addition to
		the points they received that turn
	
	- Blank Tiles have no value at any point in the game, even if placed in a previous turn
	
	- If you have a Blank Tile on a Word Premium, you will still get the word premium, it 
		just won't apply to the blank tile because the blank's value is zero
		
4. Game Ending

	- There are two ways the game can end, both once the bag of tiles is empty:
		1. When a single player uses all of their tiles
		2. When all players consecutively skip a turn
	
	- In the event that the game ends in the first way, the player who ran out of tiles adds
		the sum of the point values of every other player's remaining tiles to their score,
		while the other players subtract the sum of the point values of their remaining 
		tiles from their own score
	
	- In the event that the game ends in the second way, all players subtract the sum of the
		point values of their remaining tiles from their own score
		
5. Win Conditions:

	- At the end, the player with the most points wins, however, if multiple players are tied 
		for first place, the winner is determined by the amount of points the each player 
		had before the endgame points were taken/given to them
			- If the players score is STILL equal, it is an Absolute Tie
			
6. Misc

	- You will know how many tiles are left in the bag at the beginning of your turn. However,
		it may be misleading, because between this turn and your next turn, all other 
		players will draw new tiles at the beginning of their turns depending on how 
		many they are missing(rather than at the end of the turn)
			- This means that for example, if there are fifty tiles left in the bag, 
			and it is Player One's turn, if Player One uses all seven of their tiles, 
			there will still be fifty tiles in the bag until Player One's next turn
	
	- Once you hit "End Turn", the next player (it will say who at the top) should take control
		of the computer and hit "Continue"
			- This is to prevent players from seeing each other's tiles
			
	- You may click "Restart Turn" to undo any changes made during that turn, including tile
		swaps, and tile placements
